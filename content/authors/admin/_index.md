 Hi, my name is Manos Pavlidakis and I am a software engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/"/>University of Crete, Greece. My doctoral research on the "Transparent Spatial Sharing of Multiple and Heterogeneous Accelerators" provided extensive hands-on experience in various accelerator programing models and runtimes, including OpenCL, CUDA, and ROCm. Additionally, I am well-versed in popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Caffe, and TensorFlow, showcasing a comprehensive skill set at the forefront of technology.
